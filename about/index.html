                Hello, my name is Jakub Urbaniak and I am a current third year student at Illinois Institute of Technology. I am a transfer student
                from Elgin Community College where I have received an Associates of Science. In my free time I enjoy playing basketball/working
                out in general, watching tv shows/anime, and playing video games. I am searching for internships at the moment, but I do have
                a part time job that I work at on weekends. I work at Montrose Food Mart and Deli, a grocery store in the Chicagoland area. It
                focuses on goods imported from Europe, so it's a bit different from your average shop.
